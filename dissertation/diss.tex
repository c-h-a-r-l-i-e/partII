\chapter{Introduction}

Elite runners have historically used heart rate to provide an accurate 
measure of fitness, and allow them to train more effectively. [Expand on uses
of heart rate]. Previously, Electrocardiography (ECG) chest straps have been 
used to measure heart rate, by detecting the electrical signals controlling 
the expansion and contraction of the heart. They are accurate devices however
often prohibitively expensive, and hence inaccessible to casual runners.

In recent years, a new technology has emerged - Photoplethysmogram (PPG) 
- light is directed at the skin, and sensors measure how much blood vessels
scatter it. PPG sensors are cheaper than ECG sensors, and hence are 
available in a variety of products, particularly smartwatches. This 
innovation has bought a new wave of advanced training and monitoring onto
the wrists of any runner.

Switching from ECG to PPG is not without flaws though - ECG sensors return a
clean signal, as opposed to PPG signals which are contaminated with
noise. [More details about noise]. 

In particular when running, the motion can cause blood velocity to 
change, and the sensor can slip across the skin \cite{Wijshoff17}, 
\cite{Wood06}. These result in a distortion to the PPG signal, known as a
motion artifact (MA). Fortunately, smartwatches contain other sensors, such
as accelerometers and gyroscopes which can be used to predict the presence of 
MAs, and hence compensate for them.

My project is to research and develop a heart rate detection algorithm
for smartwatches worn during running. 

\chapter{Preparation}

In this chapter we introduce the relevant concepts for this project. I begin
with a description of the challenges that come with collecting data. Then I
move on to describing the techniques I use to actually calculate heart rate.

\section{Gathering data}


\section{Filtering}

PPGs produce a large amount of noise from various sources:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Light pollution. Both DC and AC lights in the environment can
		infiltrate the sensor, affecting the PPG signal \cite{kim15}.
	\item Temperature. As temperature increases, so does the volume of
		blood, which will be picked up by the PPG sensor 
		\cite{shin16}.
	\item Breathing. The change in pressure accosiated with respiration
		causes variations in the flow of blood, and hence can be seen
		by the PPG sensor \cite{allen02}.
\end{itemize}

In order to remove much of this noise, we can use filters to remove
frequencies we know are irrelevant. We know the heartbeat can vary from 
30 to 220 beats per minute, and hence we would like to disregard any noise 
outside of this range. In this section, I will introduce the concept of 
filters, and describe two filters useful for PPG signals.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/filter.png}}
\caption{Diagram showing filter characteristics}
\label{fig:filterdiag}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:filterdiag} displays an example filter magnitude response
diagram. This plots the amount of gain applied to each frequency. A gain of
zero means the signal is removed, a gain of one means the signal is unchanged.
The characteristics displayed are as follows.

The passband is the range of frequencies we would like to remain. In an ideal
filter, there is no loss within the passband.

Passband ripple describes the variation in amplitude \emph{within} the
passband. An ideal filter will have no passband filter, such that all
frequencies within the passband are permitted equally.

The transition width is the frequency range between the start and stop band.
Ideally, this is zero, such that frequencies outside of the passband are
instantly reduced.

The stopband is the range of frequencies we wish to remove. An ideal filter
completely removes all frequencies within the stopband.

The ideal filter, as described above, is impossible - and hence we have a
variety of filters which compromise between the desirable characteristics.
Following this, I detail two of these compromises - the Butterworth filter,
and the Chebyshev filter.


\subsection{Butterworth Filter}

The Butterworth filter aims to minimize passband ripple, at the expense of a
larger transition width. To define a Butterworth filter, multiple parameters
are used, which I will describe further here.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/butter-order-comparison.png}}
\caption{Comparison of Butterworth filter orders}
\label{fig:butterworth-order}
\end{figure}

Order (\(N\)) controls the transition width - the higher the order, the lower
the transition width. This is desirable - we want to keep the passband as
large as possible, and transition quickly to the stopband. However, it comes
at the cost of computation complexity, as higher order filters take longer to
apply. See figure \ref{fig:butterworth-order} for a plot displaying the effect
of different orders on a filter's response.

Critical frequency gives the frequency at which we want gain to drop below
\(1/\sqrt2\) from the passband. Hence we use this parameter to define the
point from which we wish to cut out noise. Figure \ref{fig:butterworth-order}
uses critical frequencies 0.4 and 4 hz, which correspond to 24 and 240 bpm, a
reasonable heart rate range.

Type describes which frequencies we cut out. There are four different
types of Butterworth filters, as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Lowpass - allow frequencies below the critical frequency.

	\item Highpass - allow frequencies above the critical frequency.

	\item Bandpass - combination of lowpass and highpass - given two
		frequencies, we want the passband to be between those
		frequencies.

	\item Bandstop - given two frequencies, put the stopband between them,
		leaving the passband outside those frequencies.
\end{itemize}

We will be using a bandpass filter, as there is low and high frequency noise
we wish to remove.

\subsection{Chebyshev Filter}

The Chebyshev filter aims to reduce the transition width as much as possible,
but to do this it introduces increased ripple.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/cheby1-rp-comparison.png}
  \caption{Chebyshev Type 1}
  \label{fig:cheby1rs}
\end{subfigure}%
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/cheby2-rp-comparison.png}
  \caption{Chebyshev Type 2}
  \label{fig:cheby2rs}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Comparison of Chebyshev filter rs values}
\label{fig:chebyrs}
\end{figure}

The filter is defined with similar parameters to a Butterworth filter - order,
critical frequencies, and type all have very similar meanings. However,
there are type 1 and 2 Chebyshev filters, with different aims. Additionally,
there is a new parameter \emph{rs}. I will explain these differences here.

Type 1 Chebyshev filters introduce passband ripple, whereas type 2 Chebyshev 
filters introduce stopband ripple. Figure \ref{fig:chebyrs} shows how these
differences manifest in the response of a second order Chebyshev filter.

The parameter \emph{rs} is defined as the maximum ripple permitted below unity
gain. Higher \(rs\) results in more ripple for a type 1 filter, but less
ripple for a part 2 filter, as is demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:chebyrs}.
Introducing more ripple is undesirable as leads to more signal distortion,
however can be advantageous as it reduces the transition width.

\section{Heart Rate Calculation}

Now we have removed noise from the signal, we should have a signal 
representing the volume of blood in veins within the arm. As the heart beats,
it sends a wave of blood through the body, forcing more blood through these
veins. Hence, peaks in the PPG signal correspond to heart beats. 

There are multiple approaches to finding heart-rate from our filtered
signals, and I will detail a few here.

\subsection{Local Maxima}

If we can find the peaks in the signal, we can count them up and divide by the
time period we count those peaks within, giving us a heart rate. One way we
can define peaks is as local maxima.

The local maxima in a signal are defined as samples which are larger than both
neighbouring samples. Finding local maxima is an easy problem to solve - 
intuitively, we can create an algorithm which iterates through the samples,
comparing each sample to it's neighbours, which has complexity \(O(n)\).

\subsection{Phase vocoder}


\section{Motion Artifact Reduction}

In this section I explore methods that can be used to reduce the effect of 
Motion Artifacts (MAs) on the PPG Signal.

\subsection{Adaptive Noise Cancellation}

Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC), as described by Widrow et al.
\cite{Widrow75}, is a technique which allows us to remove noise from a signal,
given we have another signal correlated to the noise in some way. In our 
situation, we know MAs are correlated to motion, so we can use the 
accelerometer to remove MAs. This technique is extremely useful, as it can 
still produce good results when the MAs are at the same frequency as the heart
beat, even if the MAs have a larger amplitude.

%TODO: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7867772 this may be
%helpful


\begin{figure}[tbh]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/ANC-concept.png}}
\caption{ANC overall flow}
\label{epsfig}
\end{figure}

An overview of the algorithm follows. We have signal from heartbeat \(s\) that
we want to figure out, but this is contaminated by noise from MAs \(n_0\).
We assume the PPG sensor reading \(p\) is such that \(p=s+n_0\). Additionally,
we have accelerometer sensor readings \(n_1\). We filter \(n_1\), producing
signal \(y\) and subtract this from \(p\), to produce \(z=p-y\). Our aim is to
adjust the filter, such that \(y\) is as close to \(n_0\) as possible. 

The adaptive filter aims to choose a filter such that the power output 
\(E[z^2]\) is minimized. Given \(s\) is uncorrelated with \(n_0\) and \(n_1\), and \(n_0\)
is correlated with \(n_1\), it can be proven that minimizing the output
power is equivilant to

Verbatim text can be included using \verb|\begin{verbatim}| and
\verb|\end{verbatim}|. I normally use a slightly smaller font and
often squeeze the lines a little closer together, as in:

{\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.8}\small
\begin{verbatim}

LET try(ld, row, rd) BE TEST row=all
                        THEN count := count + 1
                        ELSE { LET poss = all & ~(ld | row | rd)
                               UNTIL poss=0 DO
                               { LET p = poss & -poss
                                 poss := poss - p
                                 try(ld+p << 1, row+p, rd+p >> 1)
                               }
                             }

  FOR i = 1 TO 12 DO
  { count := 0
    try(0, 0, 0)
    writef("Number of solutions to %i2-queens is %i5*n", i, count)

\section{Adding more complicated graphics}

The use of \LaTeX\ format can be tedious and it is often better to use
encapsulated postscript (EPS) or PDF to represent complicated graphics.
Figure~\ref{epsfig} and~\ref{xfig} on page \pageref{xfig} are
examples. The second figure was drawn using \texttt{xfig} and exported in
{\tt.eps} format. This is my recommended way of drawing all diagrams.
